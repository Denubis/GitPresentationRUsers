# What I did

1. Fork mtheme to https://github.com/mqTeXUsers/mtheme

This provides a makefile and a compliation environment. Tested with 

$ make all

This produced a number of .sty files, which are the indicated and desired output.

2. Opened source/* in a text editor. 

	- Make sure to set syntax highlighting

3. Attacking colours first

In communications on campus, any single colour

Using only reds conveys a functional or
